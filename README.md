# CSRF-Leads-to-Create-Fake-Users
CSRF can create fake users by tricking an authenticated user into submitting a malicious request. The web app trusts the session, allowing unauthorized account creation, leading to privilege escalation or spam. Mitigation includes CSRF tokens, Same Site cookies, and authentication checks like CAPTCHAs.
